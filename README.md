#### Docker

Docker Compose can be used to build the container image.

```
docker compose build
```

The service will file watch application and test files so no need to rebuild the container unless a change to an npm package is made.

## How to start the service

The service can be run using the [start](scripts/start) script.

```
./scripts/start
```

This script accepts any Docker Compose [Up](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_up/) argument.

### Debugging

A debugger can be attached to the running application using port `9329`.

## How to get an output

The output of this service is an email following receipt of a valid
event received from the Azure Service Bus subscription.

Use the [AsyncAPI specification](docs/asyncapi.yaml) to obtain a test input and submit to the Azure Service Bus topic, `ffc-pay-alert`.

You can use the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/features/storage-explorer/) to view the contents of the Azure Table Storage tables.

## How to stop the service

The service can be stopped using the [stop](scripts/stop) script.

```
./scripts/stop
```

The script accepts any Docker Compose [Down](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/compose_down/) argument.

For example, to stop the service and clear all data volumes.

```
./scripts/stop -v
```

## How to test the service

The service can be tested using the [test](scripts/test) script.

```
./scripts/test
```

The script accepts the following arguments:

- `--watch/-w` - run tests with file watching to support Test Driven Development scenarios (TDD)
- `--debug/-d` - run tests in debug mode. Same as watch mode but will wait for a debugger to be attached before running tests.

## CI pipeline

This service uses the [FFC CI pipeline](https://github.com/DEFRA/ffc-jenkins-pipeline-library).
